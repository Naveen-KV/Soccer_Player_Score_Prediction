# Soccer_Player_Score_Prediction
ML application to predict overall rating of soccer player based on analysis of playing skills.

This ML application is an attempt to automate the process of providing an overall rating to soccer player based 
on his/her skill sets like passing, crossing, heading, attacking etc so that possibilities of partiality in final 
selection can be completely avoided.

The data set is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).
